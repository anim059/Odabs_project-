                            Daily routines that involve constant exposure to pollutants  have lead to common skin problems like dry skin, irritation or premature skin aging.

                            Extensive skin care treatments become difficult due to busy schedules. Read through the article and discover some easy homemade recipes to help nourish and improve your skin.

                            Egg and Glycerin Mask:
                            Whisk together 1 large egg white, about 1 1/2 tablespoon Honey and 1 tablespoon of Glycerin. Add 1 tablespoon of honey to this paste to make a smooth face mask. Apply it for 15 minutes before washing with cold water.

                            Egg whites have astringent properties that tighten the skin. Glycerine acts as a moisturizer for smooth skin. Honey helps rejuvenate the dry skin.
